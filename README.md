# NASA — North America Scootering Archive

**Do you remember?**

Do you remember when rally photos lived on scoot.net? When you'd get home Monday morning, still smelling like premix and someone else's couch, and check to see if your photos were up yet?

Do you remember refreshing the gallery page? Seeing yourself in the background of someone's shot, mid-laugh, mid-story, mid-everything that made those weekends matter?

Do you remember the patches?

This is the archive of that. All of it. Before it disappears.

## What This Is

From roughly 1997 to 2013, scoot.net was the home of North American scooter rally culture. If you went to a rally, the photos ended up there. If you wanted to know what was happening next month, you checked the calendar. If you collected patches, you knew the gallery.

Then Facebook happened. Organizing moved to event pages. Photos went to albums that disappeared when someone deleted their account. The calendar went quiet. The patches stopped being scanned.

scoot.net stayed up, but it stopped growing. And now it's just... there. Waiting.

**This archive is what we're doing about that.**

We're preserving:
- **Every rally photo** from the scoot.net gallery (1997–2013)
- **Every patch scan** from the patch gallery
- **Every event** from the calendar archive
- **The stories** people remember about all of it

And then we're picking up where it left off:
- New rallies
- New photos  
- New patches
- New stories

Because the community didn't end. It just stopped having a home.

## What We're Saving

**1,147 rallies.**  
**Approximately 85,000 photos.**  
**Hundreds of patches.**  
**Nearly two decades of going places together.**

From Amerivespa to regional rallies nobody outside three states heard of. From the big ones everyone went to, to the tiny ones that mattered just as much. From coasts to cornfields to everywhere scooters could get to.

If you were there, you're in here somewhere.

## How This Works

The technical version: Python scraper, Cloudflare hosting, static site generator, GitHub Pages.

The version that matters: **We're copying everything before it disappears, and then we're letting the community make it better.**

You'll be able to:
- **Claim your photos** — "That's me. I was there."
- **Add stories** — What you remember about that weekend
- **Correct the record** — Fix dates, names, places that got mixed up
- **Add new rallies** — The ones happening now, the ones coming next
- **Share patches** — Scan the ones you kept

The archive starts with what scoot.net saved. It grows with what *you* remember.

## The LLM Oral History Thing

Here's the part that sounds weird but will actually work:

We're building a guided storytelling system that helps you remember and share what happened. Not a form. Not a survey. A conversation.

It'll ask you questions like:
- "What rally was your first one?"
- "What do you remember about the ride there?"
- "Who did you meet that weekend that you still talk to?"

And it'll remember what you said, so the next time you add a story, it already knows your context.

Think of it like sitting around after a rally, except the thing listening doesn't forget and doesn't interrupt.

Your stories get saved with the photos. The archive becomes the record not just of *what happened*, but of *what it meant*.

---

## Why This Matters

Because communities are held together by the stories they tell about themselves.

Because "remember when" only works if there's something to point at.

Because scoot.net could go down tomorrow, and if it does, we lose the record of nearly twenty years of people going places together.

Because you were there. And that should mean something more than a dead link and a fading memory.

## What You Can Do Right Now

**If you have photos from rallies that aren't on scoot.net:** We want them.  
**If you have patches we don't have scanned:** We want them.  
**If you remember stories about rallies in the archive:** We want them.  
**If you know someone who was part of this and might not know we're doing it:** Tell them.

The archive belongs to everyone who was there.

## The Long Version (For People Who Want Details)

The site is being built in phases:

**Phase 1 (Current):** Scrape and preserve scoot.net gallery  
**Phase 2:** Download and host all images permanently  
**Phase 3:** Build the public site (browse, search, view)  
**Phase 4:** Add user accounts (claim photos, add stories)  
**Phase 5:** Oral history system  
**Phase 6:** Ongoing rally calendar and new photo submissions  
**Phase 7:** Patch gallery  

Right now we're between Phase 1 and Phase 2. The mapper has run. The data structure is built. The images are next.

---

## Who's Building This

Someone who was there.  
Someone who remembers.  
Someone who knows what gets lost when nobody writes it down.

The code is open source. The archive will be community-owned. The history belongs to everyone who lived it.

## One More Thing

If you're reading this and thinking *"I haven't thought about those rallies in years"* — good.

Now you can go look at the photos and remember.

That's why we're building this.

**Status:** Active development  
**Launch:** When it's ready  
**Contact:** [Issues on GitHub](https://github.com/rudi193-cmd/nasa-archive)

*The library is always on fire. That's why we build things that survive it.*
